    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <h4>Hello there and welcome to Aga's Bakery, the one stop shop for all of your vegan cake needs!</h4>

    <p>As a passionate vegan Aga was never completley satisfied with the limited selection of tasty cakes and treats
        available. Having always had a love of baking she decided to craft her own recipes.</p>
    <p>Finally after years of refining those recipes (as well as eating the mistakes) she took the decision to share
        her creations.</p>
    <p>All of our cakes are home made with extra care as well as being 100% vegan friendly, although even if you are not vegan they still taste amazing!</p>
    <p>So grab yourself a tasty treat to enjoy and thank you for stopping by.</p>
